## Push command behavior

### Overview

The `opkg push` command uploads a local package version from the **local registry** to the **remote registry**.
It allows:
- **Stable versions** (`x.y.z`).
- **Unversioned packages** (when `package.yml` omits `version`, represented as `0.0.0`).
It still rejects prerelease versions like `1.2.3-dev.abc`.

This document focuses on user-facing behavior:
- CLI shapes and arguments.
- Explicit vs implicit version flows.
- What happens when there are no stable versions.
- High-level stable-only guarantees.
- UX examples.

## Command synopsis

- **Command**: `opkg push <package-name>`
- **Package syntax**:
  - `<name>` – package name, optionally unscoped.
  - `<name>@<version>` – optional explicit version.
  - `<name@version>/<registry-path>` – partial push of specific registry paths.
  - `--paths <list>` – comma-separated registry paths for partial push.

Examples:
- `opkg push my-pack`
- `opkg push @scope/my-pack`
- `opkg push my-pack@1.2.3`
- `opkg push @scope/my-pack/specs/readme.md` (partial push of a single file)
- `opkg push @scope/my-pack@1.2.3 --paths specs/readme.md,specs/guide.md`

---

## Explicit version behavior: `opkg push <pkg>@<version>`

1. User runs `opkg push <pkg>@<version>`.
2. The CLI treats `<version>` as the **exact** version to push.
3. Behavior:
   - If `<version>` is a **prerelease** (e.g. `1.2.3-beta.1`):
     - The push is **rejected**.
     - The CLI prints:
       - `❌ Prerelease versions cannot be pushed: <version>`
       - `Only stable versions (x.y.z) can be pushed to the remote registry.`
       - `💡 Create a stable version using "opkg pack <package>".`
   - If `<version>` is **not found** in the local registry:
     - The CLI prints:
       - `❌ Version <version> not found for package '<pkg>'`
       - `💡 Create this stable version using "opkg pack <package>" and push again.`
   - If `<version>` is found and is **stable**:
     - That version is pushed to the remote registry following the upload flow.

**Summary**

- `opkg push pkg@1.2.3`:
  - If `1.2.3` exists and is stable → push.
  - If `1.2.3` is prerelease → reject with prerelease hint.
  - If `1.2.3` does not exist → clean “version not found” message + hint to use `opkg pack`.

---

## Implicit version behavior: `opkg push <pkg>`

When no version is specified, the command prefers **stable versions** and can fall back to a **`0.0.0`** package if no stable exists.

High-level flow:

1. Discover all versions of `<pkg>` from the local registry.
2. Compute the latest **stable** version.
3. If no stable versions exist but a **`0.0.0`** entry exists:
   - Use the `0.0.0` package as the candidate.
4. If neither stable nor unversioned exists:
   - Inform the user and exit **gracefully** (non-error).
5. If a candidate exists:
   - Prompt the user to confirm pushing that candidate.

**Details**

- If no stable versions are found but a `0.0.0` entry exists:
  - The CLI notes it will push the `0.0.0` package.
- If no stable versions and no unversioned entry:
  - The CLI prints the existing “no stable versions” message and exits successfully.
- If a stable version (e.g. `1.2.3`) is found:
  - The CLI prompts:
    - `Push latest stable version '1.2.3'?` (default: yes).
  - If the user **confirms**:
    - That version is pushed.
  - If the user **declines**:
    - The operation is cancelled cleanly (no additional error noise).

**Summary**

- `opkg push pkg`:
  - If **no stable versions**: print “no stable versions” + `opkg pack` hint, exit successfully.
  - If **stable versions exist**: pick the latest stable, prompt for confirmation, and push if confirmed.

## Partial push behavior (paths)

- Partial pushes upload only specific registry paths from an existing local package version.
- Paths can be provided via:
  - `<pkg[@ver]>/<registry-path>`
  - `--paths specs/readme.md,specs/guide.md`
- Behavior:
  1. Scope resolution and version selection run first (explicit or latest-stable).
  2. Requested paths are normalized and validated against the local package files.
     - Missing paths fail the push with a clear missing-path message.
  3. Tarball is narrowed to:
     - The requested file set.
     - `.openpackage/package.yml`.
  4. Upload uses the standard `/packages/push` endpoint.

Notes:
- This replaces the previous single-file `f` flow; single-file pushes are just partial pushes with one path.
- Manifest is required; if `.openpackage/package.yml` is missing locally, the CLI errors.


## Stable-only guarantees (behavioral view)

From the user’s perspective:

- **Prerelease versions are never pushed.**
- Any attempt to push a prerelease:
  - Fails fast with a clear message.
  - Explains that only `x.y.z` style stable versions are allowed.
  - Suggests using `opkg pack <package>` to create a stable version.
- The previous behavior of auto-converting prereleases to stable on `push` is removed:
  - `opkg push` no longer creates or modifies versions.
  - Stable creation and promotion is done via `opkg pack`.

## UX examples

### Example 1: No stable versions yet

```bash
opkg push test
```

Output:
- User may be prompted to scope the package.
- Then:
  - `❌ No stable versions found for package '@user/test'`
  - `💡 Stable versions can be created using "opkg pack <package>".`
  - Command exits successfully (no trailing plain `No stable versions found` line).

---

### Example 2: Implicit push with existing stables

```bash
opkg push @user/test
```

Assume local versions: `1.0.0`, `1.1.0-dev.abc`, `1.2.0`.

Behavior:
- Finds latest stable = `1.2.0`.
- Prompts:
  - `Push latest stable version '1.2.0'?`
- On confirmation:
  - Proceeds to tarball creation and upload of `1.2.0`.

---

### Example 3: Explicit prerelease

```bash
opkg push @user/test@1.2.0-dev.abc
```

Behavior:
- Immediately rejects:
  - `❌ Prerelease versions cannot be pushed: 1.2.0-dev.abc`
  - `Only stable versions (x.y.z) can be pushed to the remote registry.`
  - `💡 Create a stable version using "opkg pack <package>".`

---

### Example 4: Explicit missing version

```bash
opkg push @user/test@2.0.0
```

Behavior:
- If `2.0.0` is not present locally:
  - `❌ Version 2.0.0 not found for package '@user/test'`
  - `💡 Create this stable version using "opkg pack <package>" and push again.`
